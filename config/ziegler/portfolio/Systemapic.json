  "my contribution": "I performed refactoring of this project; it was written more than 400 unit, integration and system mocha tests. While writing the tests, I have revealed a large number of bugs and defects of the system, which were subsequently eliminated. I also conducted full project documentation, using apidocjs. I solved frontend issues as well as backend ones."
