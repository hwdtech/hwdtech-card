  "description": "This project is a phone interpreting service, for real-time interpretation conferencing. <br/><br/> Functionality: <br/><br/>This web application was implemented as a speech recognition client for the server. It communicates with the server via HTML5 WebSockets. <br/> <br/>Users can send WAV files to the server or record their speech via microphone and receive translations in real-time. <br/><br/> Users can change a sample rate to compress data and as a result, this web client works even with EDGE in real-time.",
